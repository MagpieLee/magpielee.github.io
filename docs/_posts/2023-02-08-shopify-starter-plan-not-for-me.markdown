[Shopify Starter plan](https://www.shopify.com/starter) caught my attention when I started a dropshipping store for the first time. It's really cheap, $5 a month. And even cheaper for the first 3 months, just $1. It seemed a no-brainer.

I followed the Setup guide Shopify Store Admin listed, setting up store information, importing AliExpress products through DSers app, editing product details, and adjusting prices of the imported products. After adding the logo image, the main banner image, I discovered there's no theme I can chooose exept the only theme, Dawn, which is rather a dull or obviously unpolished one.

It was a disappointment. $5 a month wouldn't lead me to run a real online store. I mean a site doesn't look like a test or a half-finished. I don't want my store look like unfinished.

Eventually I've upgraded to a basic plan which is $29, well if you buy annual subscription. I chose a monthly subscription which actually is $39.

I spent my afternoon picking a template for [The Seven Hours](https://the-seven-hours.myshopify.com/) shop and fill necessary information. It's still work in progress. But, I made the first order. Let's see how it goes.
