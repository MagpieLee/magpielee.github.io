Everyday is a learning experience. This morning, I was checking the status of the order that I made yesterday. One word caught my attention. `declined`.

![An error message of DSers decline my request fulfillment](/assets/images/2023/02/09/dsers-request-fulfillment-declined.png)

With some digging, the problem is because I clicked `request fulfillment` button of the order on Shofiy screen instead of requesting fulfillment on DSers yesterday. I had to manually fix the declined order by following [the instruction of re-ordering the product](https://help.dsers.com/reorder-request-fulfillment-orders/)

So remember this:

> Do not click `request fulfillment` for products with DSers on Shopify.

Instead go to DSers site and click request fulfillment under `Awaiting order` tab.

Here's how to place an order when there's a purchase on your Shopify store:
